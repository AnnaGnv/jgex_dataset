# A JGEX Dataset (CSV only)

This repository contains **one file**: a CSV spreadsheet of Euclidean geometry problems paired with natural-language text and JGEX formalizations.

- **File:** `A_JGEX_Dataset.csv`
- **Format:** one row = one JGEX instance (a problem encoding that can be executed by a JGEX-compatible solver)

## What is in the CSV?

Each row pairs:

1. the **original natural-language** problem statement (in LaTeX),
2. a **JGEX-oriented natural-language rewrite** (in LaTeX) that makes construction steps explicit,
3. the **JGEX code** for the construction and goal,
4. metadata intended to support filtering, benchmarking, and analysis.

## Column schema

The CSV contains the following columns (names match the paper, Section 3.2):

- `problem_id`  
  Integer identifier for the underlying geometry problem. May repeat across rows if a single original problem is represented by multiple JGEX instances (e.g., multi-goal encodings).

- `original_NL_problem_statement`  
  Original problem statement in LaTeX (verbatim from the source).

- `statement_source`  
  Source citation (e.g., contest/year/problem number, or textbook/exercise reference).

- `NL-JGEX_problem_statement`  
  LaTeX natural-language rewrite aligned to JGEX construction order/vocabulary; makes implicit assumptions explicit.

- `JGEX_problem_statement`  
  The executable JGEX instance: construction sequence (semicolon-separated), optional helper constructions after `|`, and one or more goals after `?`.

- `problem_runs_on_Newclid_3_0_1`  
  Execution flag indicating whether the instance runs under **Newclid v3.0.1** (e.g., `yes`/`no`).

- `NL_reference_proof`  
  Reference proof identifier/link when available; otherwise `N/A`.

- `NL_reference_proof_source`  
  Source for the reference proof (URL or citation) when available; otherwise `N/A`.

- `numerical_concept`  
  Binary annotation indicating whether the instance uses explicit numerical content (e.g., fixed angles/ratios/lengths) versus purely qualitative relations.

- `NL_construction_in_statement`  
  Counts of primitives needed to state the configuration (e.g., `point(7), segment(6), circle(1)`). These counts refer to objects needed to *formulate* the statement.

- `NL_construction_for_proof`  
  Counts of auxiliary primitives introduced to enable a standard proof strategy or to express the goal with available vocabulary; otherwise `N/A`.

- `final_answer`  
  A machine-matchable final answer token when applicable; typically `N/A` for theorem-style problems.

- `comment`  
  Free-form notes (e.g., goal reformulations, helper constructions, multi-goal encoding details, caveats).

## Notes on interpretation

- **Multi-goal / multi-row representation:** If the original mathematical conclusion is encoded as multiple JGEX goals, the same `problem_id` may appear in multiple rows with different `JGEX_problem_statement` goals.
- **Executability is versioned:** The `problem_runs_on_Newclid_3_0_1` field is tied to Newclid **v3.0.1**. Behavior may change across solver versions.
- **LaTeX fields:** Several text fields contain LaTeX (e.g., backslashes, braces). When loading the CSV, ensure your tooling preserves strings without unwanted escaping.

## Minimal usage example

You can inspect the CSV with standard tools (Python/pandas shown below):

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("A_JGEX_Dataset.csv")
print(df.columns)
print(df.head(3)[["problem_id", "statement_source", "JGEX_problem_statement"]])
