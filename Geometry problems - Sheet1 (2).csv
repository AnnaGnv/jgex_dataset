78,"Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle. Prove that triangles $ABC$ and $ACB$ are similar by an orientation‑reversing similarity (i.e., one is a mirror image of the other).",Synthetic problem: Equilateral symmetry ⇒ mirror-similarity of reversed vertex order,"Construct an equilateral triangle $ABC$. Consider the same triangle with the order of vertices reversed, namely triangle $ACB$. Show that there exists a similarity taking $\triangle ABC$ to $\triangle ACB$ that reverses orientation",a b c = ieq_triangle a b c ? simtrir a b c a c b,yes,"In an equilateral triangle, $AB=AC$ and $\angle BAC=60^\circ$. The line through $A$ and the midpoint of $BC$ is simultaneously a median, angle bisector, and perpendicular bisector; reflecting across this line swaps $B$ and $C$ and fixes $A$. Hence the reflection maps $\triangle ABC$ to $\triangle ACB$, which is a similarity with a reflection component, so it is orientation‑reversing.","Joyce’s Euclid, Book I (equilateral triangle construction and symmetry facts as standard corollaries)",no,"point(3), triangle(1)",N/A,N/A,
